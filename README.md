# Game Section

I made the game section minimalistic and fun, keeping a color theme. 
Blue replesents the "Sky" and with an added animation, it looks like is raining Donuts. 
The orange represents the heat of the oven. i used the linear gradient property to combime the two together and maintain a cohesive site.
