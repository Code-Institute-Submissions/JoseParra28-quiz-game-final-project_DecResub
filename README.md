# Game Section

I made the game section minimalistic and fun, keeping a color theme. 
Blue replesents the "Sky" and with an added animation, it looks like is raining Donuts. 
The orange represents the heat of the oven. i used the linear gradient property to combime the two together and maintain a cohesive site.

# The Banner

The second feature is the personalize banner, where the tittle, hero image, game rules and timer can be easily found. 
I have created my own tittle by creating a hero image using blender (A 3D software), i wanted to make the tille fun and appealing to the eye. 
I have called this game the way i did was because of a personal level it means quiet a lot to me. As I am changing career from a pastry chef to software developer i wanted to incorporate these two thing together. The name (</Cake!>) was inpired by my pastry chef days, the closing tags represent the closure of that chapter of my life as i am no longer a pastry chef and the exclamation mark represent the moment you type (!) when starting a new HTML file which means, new beginning to the software world. 

## Timer
I have incorporated a timer to make this game more challenging.
