## Features

# Pregame

The first feature of this game is that the user has the oportinity to create a "Cool Username" giving them the change to make this game more personal and fun. 
- I have created a validated for, the user can not access the game without typing at least one letter.
and if they click the Submit button, they will get a message to type their name

# Game Section

I made the game section minimalistic and fun, keeping a color theme. 
Blue replesents the "Sky" and with an added animation, it looks like is raining Donuts. 
The orange represents the heat of the oven. i used the linear gradient property to combime the two together and maintain a cohesive site.
- I have included a quiestion count, so that the user can keep track of how many questions are in the game

# The Banner

The second feature is the personalize banner, where the tittle, hero image, game rules and timer can be easily found. 
I have created my own tittle by creating a hero image using blender (A 3D software), i wanted to make the tille fun and appealing to the eye. 
I have called this game the way i did was because of a personal level it means quiet a lot to me. As I am changing career from a pastry chef to software developer i wanted to incorporate these two thing together. The name (</Cake!>) was inpired by my pastry chef days, the closing tags represent the closure of that chapter of my life as i am no longer a pastry chef and the exclamation mark represent the moment you type (!) when starting a new HTML file which means, new beginning to the software world. 

## Timer
I have incorporated a timer to make this game more challenging. 
When there are 10 seconds remaing, the user will get a massegu to let them know that how much time they have left.
When the timer gets to 0 the page will refresh and restart the game. 
In addition, once the user anwers all the quiestion, they will have the change to restart the game. Only if they answer all the quiestions, but there is very little time to complete the game as part of the challenge.

## Right or Wrong answer feedback 

I have created an easy way to give the user feedback. if they click the right answer, backward screen will turn Green, and if they click the wrong answer, backward screen will turn Red, the user will also be indicated which one is the right answer if the choose their answer isn't correct, they will know this by looking at the button's color. 
The user can click on the wrong answer once they get feedback if they have answered correctly.
I have not included a score tracking system as that is not the goal of this game, the game is meant to be aducational and the user can play as many times as they want without feeling defeated.
